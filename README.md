# FinalGame
final group project

Commit #1: basics

Commit #2: Got basic physics motion implemented. Need to smooth out the movement.
            Also add the mechanics that will be discussed in 5/12's meeting.

Commit #3: Basic movement works, but I need to tune in when tiles are implemented.

Commit #4: Implemented a basic tilemap for the game. Using temp assets from a
            phaser3 tutorial on youtube.

Commit #5: Implemented massive overhaul of the game in responsive to shifting our
            design of the game. Using new art assets, and implementing the prefabs
            and physics of the game as well as basic world building.

Commit #6: Implemented scene transition based on player hitting the endpoint of the
            map. Also added sound, and touched up borders.

Commit #7: Added a tilemap and incorporated collision checking.

Commit #8: fixed up some prefabs and assets.
