# FinalGame
final group project

Commit #1: basics

Commit #2: Got basic physics motion implemented. Need to smooth out the movement.
            Also add the mechanics that will be discussed in 5/12's meeting.

Commit #3: Basic movement works, but I need to tune in when tiles are implemented.

Commit #4: Implemented a basic tilemap for the game. Using temp assets from a
            phaser3 tutorial on youtube.

Commit #5: Implemented massive overhaul of the game in responsive to shifting our
            design of the game. Using new art assets, and implementing the prefabs
            and physics of the game as well as basic world building.

Commit #6: Implemented scene transition based on player hitting the endpoint of the
            map. Also added sound, and touched up borders.

Commit #7: Added a tilemap and incorporated collision checking.

Commit #8: Fixed up some prefabs and assets.

Commit #9: Organized better. Added animation. Edited levels and the interaction
            between the player with them. Still working on the kill one between
            spikes and a player.

Commit #10: Spikes work now. Need to add an endgame and restart to scenes. Make 
            level3 the patrol level. Level4 will be for the turrets. Testing out
            new camera on level1.

Commit #11: Implemented the turret animation and ability to shoot. Need to edit both.

Commit #12: Created a new level, and am rebuilding many of the mechanics around it
            and the new tileset I have now. Cleaning up some of the extra files and
            unneeded code too.

Commit #13: Made two basic levels that will be edited. Add turrets to level 2, and
            am touching up their functionality. Have to fix the reset feature on them.

Commit #14: Core game is now complete. Just need to touch up speeds/variables/sizes,
            and edit levels and make new ones. Also polish ofc.

Commit #15: Implemented parallax scrolling and camera movement. Need to resize game.
            Also need to edit the added sounds.

Commit #16: Edited scene transition. Added new sounds. Fixed code structure. Tweeked
            with some variables. Bit of polish here and there too.
